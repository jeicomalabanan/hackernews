AFAIK, for instance, the version of Minix that serves as Intel&#x27;s ME will continue to be operational even if the UEFI is replaced by Linux.<p>The issue is that &#x27;firmware&#x27; actually means many different blobs of software in various ROMs spread throughout the system, from disk controllers to GPUs to memory controllers to NIC and so on.<p>You will never be able to verify you have full control over your system unless all these firmware have the ability to be reflashed&#x2F;replaced. LinuxBoot&#x2F;Coreboot are a step in the direction, but without major concessions from hardware vendors this is an uphill battle.",
